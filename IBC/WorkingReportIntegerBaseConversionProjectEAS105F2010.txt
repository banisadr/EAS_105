Dear Student:  This is a 'working report' for the Integer Base Conversion Project. 
 
Please let me know promptly if you find a bug in this Tester Code. 

 
1) ConvertVectorBaseToBaseTen seems to work fine!
2) ConvertVectorBaseTenToBase seems to work fine!
3) ConvertVectorBaseAToBaseB seems to work fine!
4) QuickShortenVectorBaseAToBaseB and QuickLengthenVectorBaseAToBaseB both seem to work fine!
5) QuickConvertVectorBaseAToBaseB both seem to work fine!
6) Your Quick routines are NOT faster than your other ones.*****************

 
Your Quick routines should actually be faster. This Tester tests for this. Do not divert calculations to Quick routines if that's what you're doing.
